<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I am an international student from Saudi Arabia who has had an opportunity to study at the Miami International University of Art & Design. This portfolio offers not only a sample of my work and skills, but also showcases my unique stylistic range. 
I am passionate about advertising, fashion, makeup, and art. My hope is to work with individuals or creative teams to help businesses in all aspects of advertising and marketing whether it be a complete rebranding or developing creative concepts for new products.
